This repo has the working code for a robotic arm which was made by company dobot.

The robot can do following things:

1) Pick the cube from a dedicated space show it to the camera and sort the cubes according to the colour.
2) Once the cubes are done sorting it can use speech recognition to bring the cube which was said in the mic.

The arm mainly uses two main recognition softwares:
1) Colour recognition
2) Voice recognition
